# movie_renamer
A little app to rename movie folders to their respective name on "themoviedb.org"  
- This app was initially made for the management of movie-libraries in KODI

This does only work if you have organized your movies in separate folders.  
The app does ONLY rename the FOLDER to a matching movie from the database.  
_____
You always have to manually confirm the renaming of the folder!   
It does only automatically search for possible matches based on the current folder name or based on your manual inputs.  
____
The app finds and selects the original names of the movie, because these are the names the movies can be found in KODI.  
You can manually select the "input" language in config.txt (The language of your initial folder names or simply put -> your language).
